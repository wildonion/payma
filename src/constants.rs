/* 
    we cannot obtain &'static str from a String because Strings may not live 
    for the entire life of our program, and that's what &'static lifetime means. 
    we can only get a slice parameterized by String own lifetime from it, we can 
    obtain a static str but it involves leaking the memory of the String. this is 
    not something we should do lightly, by leaking the memory of the String, this 
    guarantees that the memory will never be freed (thus the leak), therefore, any 
    references to the inner object can be interpreted as having the 'static lifetime.
    
    also here it's ok to return the reference from function since our reference lifetime 
    is static and is valid for the entire life of the app

        and reaching this using String is not possible because heap data types 
        will be dropped from the heap once their lifetime destroyed in a scope
